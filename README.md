## Week 1 Activities
### *Activity Number* = 0101
Here i would like to share my recent programming project in which i used java script as a programming language in DGL 113,i did everything perfactly but at the execution time i did not get desired result of my web page , i cross checked everything but i could not find any error in programming.i was very disappointed because i spent too much time on that but still cannot solved my issues.

## Code of the problem :

var roomRate = prompt("What's your room's daily rate");

var GST=0.05 * roomRate;

var PST=0.08 * roomRate;

let myelement = document.getElementById("mydata");

myelement.innerHTML="Your room rate is $" + roomRate + "; GST is : $" + GST +" ; PST is $" + PST;

### Here actually i forget to add (.)operator before getElementById("mydata") that's why my page enable to fetch data from rooms page.

## How to solve it 
After reading "pragmatic philosophy" i open my code and study it again with fresh mind, i checked everythinhg and after sometime i find out the exact problem and solve it,it restore my confidence and am happy now because it is my assignment and finally i did it correctly as per requrements and research stratergy worked here.
